why do we need data structure?
-A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of data.

-Compiler Design,
-Operating System,
--Database Management System,
-Statistical analysis package,
-Numerical Analysis,
-Graphics,
-Artificial Intelligence,
-Simulation

what is an Array?
-An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
-An ArrayList is resizable, where as, an array is not. ArrayList is a part of the Collection Framework. We can store any type of objects, and we can deal with only objects. It is growable. Array is collection of similar data items. We can have array of primitives or objects. It is of fixed size. We can have multi dimensional arrays. Array can store primitive ArrayList: Stores object only. It fix size ArrayList: resizable. It can have multidimensional. Array lang ArrayList: Collection framework.

what is LinkedList?

-One disadvantage of using arrays to store data is that arrays are static structures and therefore cannot be easily extended or reduced to fit the data set. Arrays are also expensive to maintain new insertions and deletions. Another data structure called Linked Lists that addresses some of the limitations of arrays. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node)
of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.
-The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference. A linked list is a dynamic data structure. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand. Any application which has to deal with an unknown number of objects will need to use a linked list. One disadvantage of a linked list against an array is that it does not allow direct access to the individual elements. If you want to access a particular item then you have to start at the head and follow the references until you get to that item. Another disadvantage is that a linked list uses more memory compare with an array - we extra 4 bytes (on 32-bit CPU) to store a reference to the next node.
Types of Linked Lists:
A doubly linked list is a list that has two references, one to the next node and another to previous node.
Another important type of a linked list is called a circular linked list where last node of the list points back to the first node (or the head) of the list.

what is queue?
-A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations. Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
what is stack?
-The Stack class implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of elements. We can think of a stack literally as a vertical stack of objects; when you add a new element, it gets stacked on top of the others. When we pull an element off the stack,  it comes off the top. In other words, the last element you added to the stack is the first one to come back off.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
- FIFO is an acronym for First In, First Out, a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first.
-LIFO-Last In First Out

what is the order of complexity?
-Generally, an algorithm has an asymptotic computational complexity. Assuming the input is of size N, we can say that the algorithm will finish at O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)) etc. This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it.
-Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger. Thus, we should often seek more efficient algorithms in order to reduce the order of complexity.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-It is the case which takes less time to implement.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
-It is the case which takes maximum time to implement.

what is tree in data structure?
-In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
-A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
1)Hashtable is synchronized whereas hashmap is not. 2)Another difference is that iterator in the HashMap is fail-safe while the enumerator for the Hashtable isn't. If you change the map while iterating, you'll know. 3)HashMap permits null values in it, while Hashtable doesn't.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas:  RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data models.
-RDBMS uses:
•	Indexes (keys to point to rows containing that value)
•	Row data (non-blob data, some info here)
•	Blob data (usually bulk data; think of this as extended data that you typically don't search on, but retrieve in bulk after looking up a row by other keys)

-Network data model use relationships model.
Hierarchical data: A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value.

How HashMap works in java?
-HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time O(1) provided we know the key. In hashing, hash functions are used to link key and value in HashMap. Objects are stored by calling put(key, value) method of HashMap and retrieved by calling get(key) method.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
-Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
- use the various copyOf and copyOfRange methods of the Arrays class - probably the simplest method
-use System.arraycopy - useful when copying parts of an array
-call its clone method, and do a cast - the simplest style, but only a shallow clone is performed
-use a for loop - more than one line, and needs a loop index

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
- In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space in memory for pointer.
What is DFS and BFS?
- Distributed file System (DFS) is a set of client and server services that allow an organization using Microsoft Windows servers to organize many distributed SMB file shares into a distributed file system.
- The Boot File System (named BFS on Linux, but BFS also refers to the Be File System) was used on UnixWare to store files necessary to its boot process. It does not support directories, and only allows contiguous allocation for files, to make it simpler to be used by the boot loader.
What is Recursion?
-	Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).
-	The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. Most computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself within the program text.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
-Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
-Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists, and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list.[17] In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array's space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one. Shell sort (see below) is a variant of insertion sort that is more efficient for larger lists.
