Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
-> A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to
   each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for
   the manipulation of data.


List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
->Compiler Design,
  Operating System,
  Database Management System,
  Statistical analysis package,
  Numerical Analysis,
  Graphics,
  Artificial Intelligence,
  Simulation

what is an Array?
-> An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
->An ArrayList is resizable, where as, an array is not. ArrayList is a part of the Collection Framework. We can
  store any type of objects, and we can deal with only objects. It is growable. Array is collection of similar
  data items. We can have array of primitives or objects. It is of fixed size. We can have multi dimensional arrays.
  Array can store primitive ArrayList: Stores object only. It fix size ArrayList: resizable. It can have multi dimensional
  Array lang ArrayList: Collection framework.

what is LinkedList?
-> A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node)
   of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.
   The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node,
   but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference. A linked list is a dynamic
   data structure. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand.

what is queue?
-> A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide
   additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations. Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements
   in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.


what is stack?
->The Stack class implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of elements. We can think of a stack literally as a vertical
  stack of objects; when you add a new element, it gets stacked on top of the others. When we pull an element off the stack,
   it comes off the top. In other words, the last element you added to the stack is the first one to come back off.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
->FIFO= First In, First Out.
-> LIFO= Last In, First Out.
what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
->
what is graph in data structure?
->
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
->Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects
typically perform better than synchronized ones. Hashtable does not allow null keys or values.  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
->When we pass Key and Value object to put() method on Java HashMap, HashMap implementation calls hashCode method on Key object
and applies returned hashcode into its own hashing function to find a bucket location for storing Entry object,
important point to mention is that HashMap in Java stores both key and value

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
-> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when an array is accessed with an illegal index.
The index accessed may be:
>>Negative or
>.equal to the size of array
>>greater than the size of array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
->here are several ways to copy an array:
  use the various copyOf and copyOfRange methods of the Arrays class - probably the simplest method
  use System.arraycopy - useful when copying parts of an array
  call its clone method, and do a cast - the simplest style, but only a shallow clone is performed
  use a for loop - more than one line, and needs a loop index

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
-> An array is a group of data structures that is stored as a contiguous piece of memory, e.g. Memory locations 100, 101, 102, 103,
 and so on. Difference between array and linked list is that  memory is fixed during compile time with arrays
 and with linked lists memory is allocated during run time as you need it.
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
