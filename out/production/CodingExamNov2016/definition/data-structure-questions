Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans: is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:Compiler Design
    Operating System
    Database Management System
    Statistical analysis package
    Numerical Analysis
    Graphics
    Artificial Intelligence
    Simulation
what is an Array?
Ans: is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Array is static in size that is fixed length data structure, One can not change the length after creating the Array object.
ArrayList object  has instance variable capacity which indicates the size of the ArrayList.
As elements are added to an ArrayList its capacity grows automatically.

what is LinkedList?
Ans: linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer.

what is queue?
Ans:A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?
Ans:A stack is a data structure that allows data to be inserted, and removed.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans:
LIFO If costs are increasing, the last items sold are the most expensive, so your cost of goods sold increases, you report fewer profits, and therefore pay a smaller amount of income taxes in the near term.
FIFO If costs are increasing, the first items sold are the least expensive, so your cost of goods sold decreases, you report more profits, and therefore pay a larger amount of income taxes in the near term.

what is the order of complexity?
Ans:Is finding the upper limit for the growth of some function

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
depends if the desired element is the first element in the array then
that case would be the best.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
difficult to determine the worst case
what is tree in data structure?
Ans:a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
Ans:It consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans:Iterator in the HashMap is fail-safe while the enumerator for the Hashtable isn't.
HashMap permits null values in it, while Hashtable doesn't.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java?
It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time.
In hashing, hash functions are used to link key and value in HashMap.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?


What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: With a linked list, iterators can also traverse the list while modifications are occurring.
In the optimistic case where modifications don't collide, iterators can continue without contention.
With an array, any change that modifies the size of the array is likely to require locking a large portion of the array and in fact, it's rare that this is done
without a global lock across the whole array so modifications become stop the world affairs.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans:BFS in directed graphs, each edge of the graph either connects two vertices at the same level, goes down exactly one level, or goes up any number of levels.
For DFS, each edge either connects an ancestor to a descendant, a descendant to an ancestor, or one node to a node in a previously visited subtree.
What is Recursion?
Ans:In which a method calls itself to solve some problem.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans:Classify algorithms by how they respond to changes in input size, such as how the processing time of an algorithm changes as the problem size becomes extremely large.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
