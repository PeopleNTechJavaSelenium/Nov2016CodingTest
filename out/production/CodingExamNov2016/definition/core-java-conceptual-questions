Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
-> jdk: Java Development kit. jdk composed of JRE, javac compiler, javadoc (jar).
What is IDE?
-> Integrated Development Environment.
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
-> Eclipse, Intellij.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
-> When we write source code in notepad or IDE, it need to be converted into Byte code by javac compiler. It is in the form of class. The class
file then loads into JVM using java loader. Then the JVM sends all the information to the operating system which shows the output.

what is class?
-> Class is the Blueprint or templates to create objects.
What is object?
-> An object is an instance of class where it defined the characteristics of the class
What is the entry point of an application?
-> Main method is the entry point.
Why main is static?
-> The main method is static because when JVM call the main method it can call without creating an instance of the class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-> In Interface, you are not allowed to implement any method but in Abstract class you can implement non-abstract method and
declare abstract method. Interface and Abstract class can’t be instantiated. Interface can’t execute any methods. you can declare
method but can’t implement in the interface but you can take the same methods by implementing in abstract class and create methods
and call those methods in the "concrete Test Class"

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
what is Access Specifier?
-> Encapsulation: encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors
-> Abstraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
-> Inheritance: In java one class could derived form another. It's to get the fields and methods of its superclass, this
feature called inheritance.
-> Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take many forms.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-> OOP: Object Oriented Programing.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-> Application Programming Interface. Core java API.
Does java support multiple inheritance?
-> Yes, by instantiating objects.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
-> Method overloading allows class to have multiple methods with the same name but different signature type.It happens during
   compile time.
What is method overriding and when it happens?
-> If a class inherits a method from its super class, then the method could be overridden if it is not final. Method overriding
   happens during runtime.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-> In Java, exceptions are objects. during a program compilation if the execution of the program behave
   unexpectedly, exception occurred. In java try-catch and throw exception two most popular way to handle exception

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-> The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class.
   Static variables and methods can be called in the main method without instantiating any objects. Static variables can be
   used in non-static methods.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
-> Variable can not be changed, you must initialize the value.
What is final, finally and finalize?
-> final keyword is used toward the unchangeable variable.
-> finally is used in a try/catch statement to execute code always
->finalize is called when an object is garbage collected. You rarely need to override it

What is a constructor ?
-> The main purpose of constructor is to instantiate an object. Every class has a constructor by default. In one class
   you can have multiple constructor. If you pass the parameter in the constructor then in the main method you have to pass
   the parameters. Constructor's name should be exactly same as the class name.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
->  "this" keyword is used when you need to use class global variable in the constructors. this is a reference to
   the current object — the object whose method or constructor is being called.

What is "super" keyword in java?
-> Super keyword in java is when we call one class into another, the extended class is the super class.
What is JVM stand for ?
-> Java Virtual Machine.
What version of java are you using?
-> Java 1.8
What is JAR stand for ?
-> Java Archive.
What is compile time and run time?
-> Compile time: The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become an executable program. This compilation
   process is referred to as compile time.
-> Run Time: A compiled program can be opened and run by a user. When an application is running, it is called runtime.
What is heap?
-> The Java heap is the amount of memory allocated to applications running in the JVM.

How java manage it's memory?
->
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
->String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created, whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are
  mutable so they can change their values.
