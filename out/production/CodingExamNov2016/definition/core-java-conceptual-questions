Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans:Java Development Kit ,primary compenents a collection of programming tools that developers need to compile and run.
What is IDE?
Ans: a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans:Eclipse, IntelliJ
Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans:1.)a Java program is written using either a Test Editor or an IDE and saved as a .java file.
2.)The java file is then compiled using Java compiler and a .class file is obtained from it.
3.)The .class file is now portable and can be used to run this java program in any platform.
4.)Class file is interpreted by the JVM installed on a platform.

what is class?
Ans:blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors

What is object?
Ans:an instance of a class,object in an object-oriented program has an identity. In other words, every occurrence of a particular type of object —an instance — can be distinguished
from every other occurrence of the same type of object as well as from objects of other types.

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: entry point is where control is transferred from the operating system to a computer program,
at which place the processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution begins.
Why main is static?
Ans:This is neccesary because main() is called by the JVM before any object ,we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans:Interface support multilple inheritance whereas abstract class does not..interface does not have Constructors and Abstract class does.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans:use it as a blueprint for other Object.
what is Access Specifier?
Ans: object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans: Abstraction is a powerful methodology to manage complex systems. Abstraction is managed by well-defined objects and their hierarchical classification.
Encapsulation keeps the data and the code safe from external interference.
Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.
Polymorphism is one method with multiple implementation, for a certain class of action. And which implementation to be used is decided at runtime depending upon the situation
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans:

Does java support multiple inheritance?
Ans:no,only extend from one class but implement mutilple interfaces.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: two methods having same method name but takes different input parameters.
This called static because, which method to be invoked will be decided at the time of compilation

What is method overriding and when it happens?
Ans:means a derived class is implementing a method of its super class.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans:An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
Handling allows us to control the normal flow of the program by using exception handling in program.
It throws an exception whenever a calling method encounters an error providing that the calling method takes care of that error.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans:Static is a Non Access Modifier,
Class variables also known as static fields share characteristics across all Objects within a Class.
When you declare a field to be static, only a single instance of the associated variable is created
A Static Method can not access an instance variable.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans:Once declared final, Class can not be sub classed. Hence no method can ever be overridden.
Method will be same in all scenario


What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans:Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
Ans: a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes an object of that type.
A constructor is an instance method that usually has the same name as the class
What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans:this keyword is referring from the constructor method

What is "super" keyword in java?
Ans: super is used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans:Java Virtual Machine is a program that runs pre compiled Java programs, which mean JVM executes .class files and produces output.

What version of java are you using?
version 8
What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive. It is a compressed file, which means that it is a file that has been reduced in size.

What is compile time and run time?
Ans:This compilation process is referred to as compile time. A compiled program can be opened and run by a user.
Runtime is when a program is being executed. That is, when you start a program running in a computer, it is runtime for that program.

What is heap?
Ans: is a region of your computer's memory that is not managed automatically for you, and is not as tightly managed by the CPU.

How java manage it's memory?
Ans:Java automatically  manages memory by using the garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Ans:String- The object created as a String is stored in the  Constant String Pool  .
StringBuffer-StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object .
StringBuilder-StringBuilder is fast as it is not thread safe .
