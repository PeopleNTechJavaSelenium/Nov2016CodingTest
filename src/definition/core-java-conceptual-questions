Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
    JDK is a superset of JRE, and contains everything that is in JRE, plus tools such as compilers and debuggers
    necessary for developing applets and applications.

What is IDE?
    IDE - Integrated Development Environment, is a software application which enables users to more easily write
    and debug Java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
    Eclipse, Intellij, NetBeans etc.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
    First your in text editor, then write your source code, then it goes through Javac Compiler and turns into
    Bytecode (.class), then the .class file loads into the JVM using java loader, and then JVM sends the information
    to the Operating System which shows the output.

what is class?
    Class is composed of methods and variables. It can also have constructors.

What is object?
    Object is an instance of a class. An object has three characteristics state, behavior, identity.

What is the entry point of an application?
    The main method is the entry point of a Java application.
    When the Java Virtual Machine is told to run an application by specifying its class, it will look for the
    main method: public static void main(String[])

Why main is static?
    The static keyword allows main to be called before an object of the class has been created. This is needed
    because main is called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static so directly invoked
    from class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
    In Interface, you are not allowed to implement any method but in Abstract class you can implement non-abstract
    method and declare abstract method.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
    Interface and Abstract class can not be instantiated. You can instantiate one of their
    subclasses/implementers.

what is Access Specifier?
    public, protected, private

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
    OOP - Object Oriented Programming. The features of OOP are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
    Abstraction is Implementation hiding. Encapsulation is data hiding. Inheritance is acquire the properties
    from one class to another. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Method overloading
    and Method overriding.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
    API - application programming interface, is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for
    building application software. Some API I used are BufferedReader, Random, Scanner, ArrayList, LinkedList, String.

Does java support multiple inheritance?
    Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. But C++, Common lisp and a few other languages supports multiple
    inheritance.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
    Method Overloading is the feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having the same name.
    Happens in Compile time.

What is method overriding and when it happens?
    Method Overriding is the ability of a subclass to override a method. Happens in Run time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
    An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. When an Exception occurs the normal
    flow of the program is disrupted as the program/Application terminates abnormally, which is not recommended,
    therefore, these exceptions are to be handled.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
    Once you declare a variable and method as static, you can access it by writing classname. the properties.
    That means you don't have to create an instance. Static variable belongs to the class and non static variable
    belongs to specific object. Static variable can be used in non static methods but a non static variable can not
    be used in static methods.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
    If you declare a variable that is final, no object can change the value of that variable. That's the purpose
    of declaring final variable. You can not override a method that is final. So like once you make a method final,
    in a sub class you can not override that method.

What is final, finally and finalize?
    Final can be used to mark a variable unchangeable. Final can also make a method not overrideable. Final can
    also make a class not inheritable, the class can not be subclassed. Finally is used in a try/catch statement
    to execute code always. Finally clause will be executed regardless if operation is successful or not.
    Finalize is called when an object is garbage collected. You rarely need to override it.

What is a constructor ?
    Constructor is to initialize the object.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
    Keyword "this" in java works as a reference to the current Object whose Method or constructor is being invoked.
    It can be used inside the method or constructor of class.

What is "super" keyword in java?
    Keyword "super" in java is a reference variable that is used to refer immediate parent class object.

What is JVM stand for ?
    Java Virtual Machine

What version of java are you using?
    jdk1.8.0_111

What is JAR stand for ?
    JAR stands for "Java ARchive". A JAR file is a zip file that usually contains compiled Java code (.class).

What is compile time and run time?
    This compilation process is referred to as compile time. A compiled program can be opened and run by a user.
    When an application is running, it is called runtime.

What is heap?
    The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. The heap
    is created on virtual machine start-up.

How java manage it's memory?
    Memory management is the process of allocating new objects and removing unused objects to make space for those
    new object allocations. Java Garbage Collection is the process to identify and remove the unused objects from
    the memory and free space to be allocated to objects created in the future processing.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
    String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created. Whereas StringBuffer and
    StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values. The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder
    is that StringBuffer is thread-safe. So when an application needs to be run only in a single thread then it is
    better to use StringBuilder. StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
