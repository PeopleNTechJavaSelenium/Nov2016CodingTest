Explain the entire java life cycle.
ANS;
First, you have to write a code in a editor (ex.Eclipse,Intellij,...) and you get a output of a source code.
Second,the java compiler reads the source code, turns it into a bytecode and turns it into a .class file.
Third, in the JVM, the class loader loads the .class file, Bytecode Verifier check for any errors and displays our code
what is class?
ANS;
A class is an  program-code-template for creating objects
What is object?
ANS;
Object are instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
What is the entry point of an application?

Why main is static?
ANS:
Static -access modifier means we can call this method directly using class name without creating an object of it.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
ANS:
 An Abstract class has abstract method that is declared, but contains no implementation.
An Interface class  is a collection of abstract methods, interface class implements a abstract class, therefore
inheriting the abstract method

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
ANS:
No, you cant create a object from an interface and abstract class. You would have create a concrete class which extends the abstract class

what is Access Specifier?
ANS:
A Access specifier are set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
ANS:
OOP is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.
Inheritance-A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class).
Polymorphism-Having a method with the same name but with different values.
Abstraction-Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods
Encapsulation-In encapsulation Declare the variables of a class as private and provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
ANS:
API stands for Application Programming Interfaces
API are classes that are builtin with in java.

BufferedReader
FileReader
Math
Date
Does java support multiple inheritance?
ANS:
Java does't support multiple inheritance
What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading is when you have two more methods with the same name.
Method overloading occurs in the compile time.
What is method overriding and when it happens?
ANS:
Declaring a method in subclass which is already present in parent class.
Method overriding occurs in the runtime.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
ANS:
You use  exceptions to see if there was a error
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
ANS:
Static means that it is shared for all the classes
You can call the static methods even if you didn't create the object
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
ANS:
Final means you can't change the values or methods
What is final, finally and finalize?
ANS:
Final- A class or method can't be change
Finally-Use for place a important code
Finalize-Its use for cleaning up.
What is a constructor ?

What is JAR stand for ?

What is compile time and run time?
ANS:
The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program.
The runtime or execution environment is the part of a language implementation which executes code.
What is heap?
ANS:
How java manage it's memory?
